Climate is the only serious deterrent which might spoil your travel plans to Ooty. But regarding climate too, Ooty has something different to offer all throughout the year. The summer is perhaps the best time to visit the place, if you are planning to visit all the tourist spots, including some adventurous treks and hand gliding. With plenty of parks, museums and lakes around, you will need ample time to soak in the views. So, if you want to enjoy a leisure holiday in Ooty, you will have to set aside 3-4 days."

           "The Valparai range is habitat to the Nilgiri tahr, an endemic wild ungulate. These mountain goats inhabit the high ranges and prefer open terrain, cliffs and grass-covered hills, a habitat largely confined to altitudes from 1200 to 2600m in the southern Western Ghats.Their territory extended far and wide all along these hills in the past, but, because of hunting and large-scale habitat destruction, they now exist only in a few isolated sites like the Anaimalai Hills.The human-elephant conflict here is a delicate issue. The tea plantations are a hindrance to the movement of wildlife, particularly elephants who walk large distances to reach water bodies and feeding areas. There will be no animals wandering around during the monsoon period (june), mostly wild boar, gaurs, and lion-tail macaques can be noticed. "
